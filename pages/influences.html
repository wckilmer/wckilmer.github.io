Some are creators I'm inspired by creatively, some manage to be extremely entertaining while also being informative, and some are even part of the reason I enjoy many of the things I do! Most of all, I just think these people do cool stuff, and I think they're worth looking into!</p>

      <a>While this video doesn't deal with the fascinating functionality of everyday household wares, like many of the videos on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TechnologyConnections/featured">Technology Connection Youtube Channel</a> do, it's one of my favorites, simply because of the beauty of the electromechanical nature of the pinball machine in the video. He has done other videos about electromechanical stuff, like a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmGaXEmfTIo">jukebox</a> (that video is really cool too!) but this pinball video puts everything together. Everything I love about knowing how things work is in this video. It's extraordinarily complex, while also being remarkably simple. It's incredibly interesting to me what can be done with relays, cams, and switches.</a>
