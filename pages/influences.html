    <p align="center" style="margin-left:200px; margin-right:200px; text-align:justify">Here I wanted to compile some creators I respect and follow! Some are creators I'm inspired by creatively, some manage to be extremely entertaining while also being informative, and some are even part of the reason I enjoy many of the things I do! Most of all, I just think these people do cool stuff, and I think they're worth looking into!</p>

      <a><a style="color:blue" href="https://www.youtube.com/@TechnologyConnections/featured" target="_blank">Technology Connections</a> is a YouTube channel run by a lovely guy named Alec. Alec makes fascinating and entertaining videos about the (often surprising) ways various common things work. A favorite video of mine is one about thermostats, wherein Alec breaks down the beautifully elegant functionality of the common household thermostat, or at least the old fashioned ones based on a bimetallic strip. I have included this video below:</a><br>

      <a>I love the way such simple properties of materials are able to be taken advantage of and engineered to perform a specific task. Another video from Technology Connections that I adore is the video about <a style="color:blue" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue-1JoJQaEg&t=17s" target="_blank">pinball machines</a>. While pinball machines are hardly ordinary household devices, this video remains one of my favorites, simply because of the beauty of the pinball machine's electro-mechanical nature. Alec has also made other videos about electro-mechanical stuff, like <a style="color:blue" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmGaXEmfTIo" target="_blank">this one</a> about a jukebox. These videos about electro-mechanical stuff combine everything I love about knowing how things work. These devices are extraordinarily complex, while also being remarkably simple. The intricate tasks that can be performed by nothing but relays, cams, and switches are infinitely fascinating to me.</a>
