    <p align="center" style="margin-left:200px; margin-right:200px; text-align:justify">I've been making 3D models with CAD software since I was in middle school, and over the years I've grown to really enjoy it. In 2024, I bought a 3D printer, and I've been using it almost nonstop since! I've been modeling little doodads for various purposes and printing them. Below are a few of the things I've made!</p>

      <a>When two of the keys on my beloved 1962 Baldwin Orgasonic electric organ were broken by a falling radio, I took matters into my own hands! With the pieces of the broken keys, I used Autodesk Fusion and a caliper to create very accurate models that I was able to print and install onto my organ. The models are parameterized, so that by only changing a few numbers I can print any of the keys! I have already uploaded the finished keys to <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7006783"; target="_blank">Thingiverse</a>, but I'll host them here as well for your convenience! Below are links to a zip containing the parameterized Fusion model and a text file with the parameter settings for each key, as well as a zip containing the full set of STLs:</a>

      <a>My lovely 3D Printer (dubbed Gerald) suffers from one major inconvenience: it takes a micro SD card. My PC (and pretty much any computer I'd be trying to print from) only has a full-sized SD card reader. I got sick of always needing to find the adapter, so I decided to do the closest thing to giving Gerald a full sized SD card reader I could with my immediate surroundings: I created a little holder so Gerald would always have an adapter on him. This has made things much simpler, as Gerald is always conveniently holding the micro SD to full-sized SD adapter! I modelled this card holder such that it would slot right into the frame of the printer. Gerald is an AnyCubic Kobra 2, so in case you've got the same printer, a download link to the STL is provided below!</a>
